# Bandcamp Play/Pause Chrome extension

Most of the streaming platforms use the spacebar as a control to stop or resume the playback: Bandcamp does not and this is frustating sometimes.

This is a simple Chrome extension to enable this play/pause behaviour and prevent default scrolling behaviour.

## Installation
0. download and extract the zip file containing the extension
1. go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. enable developer mode (the toggle up right)
3. click on Load Unpacked
4. select the folder unzipped at step 0
5. ðŸš€
